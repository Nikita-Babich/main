Janestreet puzzles 


* Came up with a new chess variant "Heavy chess". 8 pawns, 4 knights, 4 bishops, 4 rooks, 3 queens, 1 king. Pawns are placed on the third row, king is placed randomly on the first row, other pieces randomly fill the left space. To make playing easier created a heavy chess position generator for Lichess - couple clicks and you can challenge your friend.
