___Under construction___
I will gradually fill this page with links to my projects/ideas/hobbies/thoughts/"about me".

* Accelcurve https://nikita-landwalker.itch.io/accelcurve - My first downloadable game (Windows). Made in 2d. 


* Thue - My string substitution turing complete language implementation in Javascript. Very slow, but cool.


* Last year i tried to make a 3d rendering in 2d framework. 
I have couple videos about that programming journey, short and long. 
When i saw an addon for "Garry's mod" called "LIDAR", 
i challenged myself to make a similar thing and made another version of the program: 
Lidar programming challenge. https://youtu.be/1QWyA5mqaG8

* I have a youtube. It is not themed, just a personal page. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmogttVr_1kuTVPJB5chN5g
* Came up with a new chess variant "Heavy chess". 8 pawns, 4 knights, 4 bishops, 4 rooks, 3 queens, 1 king. Pawns are placed on the third row, king is placed randomly on the first row, other pieces randomly fill the left space. To make playing easier created a heavy chess position generator for Lichess - couple clicks and you can challenge your friend.
* Nexus chess
* Defcon Chess
